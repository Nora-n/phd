  <caption>A Dazzling Hubble Collection of Supernova Host Galaxies</caption>
  <note>Spanning from 2003 to 2021, this collection of 37 images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope features galaxies that are all hosts to both Cepheid variables and supernovae. These two celestial phenomena are both crucial tools used by astronomers to determine astronomical distance, and have been used to refine our measurement of Hubbleâ€™s constant, the expansion rate of the Universe.</note>
