\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {I.1}{\ignorespaces \textit {Main}: SED-fitted host mass ($M_\mathrm {host}$) as a function of the LsSFR for SNfactory SNe. The color corresponds to the probability, $p_y$, for the SNe~Ia to be young, i.e., to have $\log \mathrm {LsSFR} \geq -10.82$ \citep [see][]{rigault2020}. \textit {Right}: $p_y$-weighted histogram of the SN masses, as well as the adjusted model; contributions of the younger and older population are shown in purple and yellow, respectively.\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.5}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {I.2}{\ignorespaces \textit {Orange}: Estimated fraction of young SNe as a function of redshift. \textit {Histograms}: Number of SNe in bins of redshift for the 3 main surveys of the Pantheon sample, not scaled. \textit {Red vertical lines}: For each $z$, a random number $a$ between 0 and 1 is picked: if it's lower (higher) than $\delta (z)$ at that redshift then the SN will be young (old), and the distributions of mass and stretch to pick from will follow this flag.\relax }}{6}{figure.caption.8}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {I.3}{\ignorespaces \textit {Top}: 2D hexagonal histograms of the simulated data using the P21 setup in color (left: $x_1$ v $z$, right: $x_1$ v $M_\mathrm {host}$) and actual Pantheon data in blue points. \textit {Bottom}: same data but 2D hexagonal histograms of the simulated program using the N21 improved HOSTLIB.\relax }}{10}{figure.caption.10}
